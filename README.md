Libraries Used
Backend (Python)

Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.

Flask-CORS: A Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper.

Flask-Migrate: A Flask extension for database migrations.
Frontend (JavaScript)

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: A routing library for React applications.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.

Bootstrap: A front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.

React Bootstrap: React components built with Bootstrap.
Licensing

Frontend Architecture:
React Application:
Components: The frontend is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Components are the building blocks of the application, representing UI elements such as navigation bars, menus, and food item cards.
State Management: React uses its state management system to handle data and UI state within the application. State can be managed locally within components or globally using libraries like Redux.
Routing: React Router is used for client-side routing, allowing navigation between different pages or views within the application without the need for a full page refresh.
Styling: CSS and possibly CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less are used for styling the components. Additionally, frontend frameworks like Bootstrap may be utilized for responsive design and pre-styled UI components.
HTTP Requests:
Axios: Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend server. These requests are used to fetch data from the server, such as food items, menus, and user information.

Backend Architecture:
Flask Web Server:
Flask App: The backend server is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The Flask app handles incoming HTTP requests from the frontend and provides responses accordingly.
Routes: Routes are defined in the Flask app to handle different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST) for various endpoints. These routes typically correspond to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources such as food items, menus, and user accounts.
Controllers/Views: In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, controllers (or views in Flask) handle the business logic of the application. They process incoming requests, interact with the database (if necessary), and return appropriate responses.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): SQLAlchemy, an ORM library, is often used with Flask to interact with the database. It allows developers to define database models as Python classes and perform database operations using Python syntax.
Database:
SQL Database: The application data is stored in a SQL database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. The database contains tables for storing information about food items, menus, user accounts, orders, and other relevant entities.
Database Models: Database models are defined using SQLAlchemy's ORM. Each model corresponds to a table in the database and contains fields representing attributes of the entity it represents (e.g., food item name, price, description).
Authentication and Authorization:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JSON Web Tokens are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. When a user logs in, they receive a JWT, which is then included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user and authorize access to protected endpoints.
Flask Extensions: Flask extensions such as Flask-JWT-Extended or Flask-Login may be used to handle user authentication and session management.
Deployment:
The SOJU Foods app can be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.
Deployment tools like Docker and Kubernetes may be used to containerize the application and manage deployment at scale.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can automate the deployment process, ensuring smooth and efficient updates to the application.
This architecture allows the SOJU Foods app to provide a robust, scalable, and responsive user experience while efficiently managing data and interactions between the frontend and backend components.
